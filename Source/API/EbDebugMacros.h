// 1. Track the POCs in the entrance and exit of the encoding pipeline,
//    by forcibly printing the 1st DEADLOCK_DEBUG log in RC, and the
//    last DEADLOCK_DEBUG log in PK;
// 2. Reorder the POC numbers of RC and PK separately, to check the
//    1st POC which couldn't be outputted from PK;
// 3. Open the DEADLOCK_DEBUG switch, and change the MIN_POC & MAX_POC
//    values clamping the range where that POC locates;
// 4. Check the specific stage where that POC can't go through.
